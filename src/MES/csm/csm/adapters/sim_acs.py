"""SimAcs - an ACS adapter that drives the real Gazebo robot.

Same interface as MockAcs, but instead of pretending a robot travelled it moves
the simulated Foil_A082 and reports ARRIVED when it gets there. That swap is the
whole argument for the adapter layer: the CSM, its main cycle and its job
FSM are unchanged. Only the class behind AcsAdapter differs.

Three things this file has to get right, each learned the hard way:

**Navigate on ground truth, not wheel odometry.** Wheel odometry integrates
wheel rotation, so a robot jammed against a pallet reports metres of travel it
never made. Navigating on /odom therefore let the robot "arrive" at a goal it
was nowhere near, and the job was marked DONE while the chassis sat motionless
against an obstacle. /odom_truth comes from the simulator. On the real robot the
equivalent is Seer's localisation; the wheel /odom remains what it is.

**Avoid obstacles.** The first version drove straight at the goal and ploughed
into pallet_a. The robot already carries two SICK scanners, so avoidance uses
them: a repulsion vector from nearby returns is added to the attraction toward
the goal. This is a reactive potential field, not a planner — it will not escape
a concave trap, and routing remains the real ACS's job.

**Detect being stuck.** Comparing commanded motion against ground-truth motion
catches the case where the robot is driving hard and going nowhere. Without it a
jam is silent: the ACS keeps reporting IN_PROGRESS, and even the job timeout
reads as "slow" rather than "wedged".
